## 🧭 Philosophy in Code

> “Architecture is negotiation between ambition and reality.”  
> I build systems that are not only scalable and maintainable, but intellectually honest. Whether reconstructing ENIAC simulations or designing enterprise APIs, I approach every challenge with clarity, precision, and respect for complexity.
